## Rules
 
You can use the language and technology of your choosing. It's OK to try something new (tell us if you do), but feel free to use something you're comfortable with.

Up to 8 hours. We do not expect you to complete the assessment in this time.
 
## Bonuses:
 
- Design and implement your solution as you would do for real production code.
- Containerize with Docker.
 
## Submission
 
1. Upload your code to Github, Gitlab, or Bitbucket, ensuring that your solution is easily visible for reviewers, and include the following:
   - ALL the functionality of your API should be documented so we know what it does, and how to interact with it
   - Outline what else needs to be done if given more time
   - Instructions on how to run it
2. Send via email to razi@mettleai.com
